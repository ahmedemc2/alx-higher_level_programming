print("The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n\nBeautiful is better than ugly.\n\
Explicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex.\nComplex is\
 better than complicated.\nFlat is better than nested.\nSparse is better than d\
ense.\nReadability counts.\nSpecial cases aren\'t special enough to break the\
 rules.\nAlthough practicality beats purity.\nErrors should never pass silently\
.\nUnless explicitly silenced.\nIn the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptatio\
n to guess.\nThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do\
 it.\nAlthough that way may not be obvious at first unless you\'re Dutch.\nNow\
 is better than never.\nAlthough never is often better than *right* now.\nIf th\
e implementation is hard to explain, it\'s a bad idea.\nIf the implementation\
 is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\nNamespaces are one honking great\
 idea -- let\'s do more of those!")
